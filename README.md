# CarAutomation

## Description
. The project aims to automate a regular mechanical car.

. ATmega32 is responsible to handle the received signals and control the car actuators to do basic actions like (moving, rotating, and controlling speed) and being ready for urgent interrupts.

. Raspberry Pi 3 is responsible for transmitting signals to ATmega32 for proper action using the camera as a sensing device for surroundings.

. Some signals interrupt the running process to achieve real-time operating system (RTOS) purposes.

. The security system of the car depends on using the camera to recognize non-owner faces and sending alert messages to the owner through the mobile application if anyone tries to open the car.

. Tools used to deal with Raspberry Pi: puTTY, VNC Viewer, and PyCharm IDE.



## Directories
